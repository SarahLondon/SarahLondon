    <p>Sarah (Italy) went to Manchester to study <em>coding</em> and turned it into her new career!</p>
    <p>When Marcella (Spain) returned from her holiday, her company had just aquired an important US client. The fact that she was able to speak <em>English</em> meant that the client was assigned to her, and that granted her a promotion. She cannot think of a better way to have fun and progress her career!</p>

    <p>Alan Stevenson (London) is a regular customer. He attends <em>cookery classes</em> around Europe every year so that he can entertain his family and friends. He is on his way to Napoli where is going to learn how to make real Italian Pizza!</p>
